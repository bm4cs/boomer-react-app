My react playground. If interested I've made lots of [notes](https://www.bencode.net/posts/2019-05-05-react/).


Branches:

* `master` simple bootstrap styled `Counter` components that demonstrate most of what React brings to the table (one way binding, state management, lift up state, component hierachies, HoC's).
* `router` the [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/) in action. I cobbled together a `SideBar` component that list out the latest publically available gists (https://api.github.com/gists). Clicking the a gist in the `SideBar` uses the router to display the gist body in the main page.
* `blueprint` my hack messing around with the Palantir [Blueprint](https://blueprintjs.com/) component library.
